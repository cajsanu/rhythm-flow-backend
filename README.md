## Vision

You are required to build a fullstack project management system similar to Trello, Jira, or Monday.

The project can be single- or multi-tenant.

The main requirements are as follows:

- **User Management**
- **Projects and Workspaces**
- **Tasks and Issues**

To take the project to the next level, consider these additional requirements:

- **Collaboration**
- **Real-time Collaboration**
- **Integration with Other Platforms**
- **Reporting and Analytics**

### Business Requirements

- Brainstorm the backend design in terms of entity structure and how they will interact.
- Discuss the implementation of architecture: CLEAN, DDD, TDD, and any possible pattern your team want to apply (repository pattern, CQRS, etc.).
- **Deadline Management**: Use any project management tool of your choice to ensure timely delivery.

## Requirements

_For team assignment, only 1 member should fork the repo, then the admin can invite other members to contribute in the same repo. All members, including the admin, should fork from the common repo, making PRs when changes are needed. Remember to have a develop branch before merging to main. Each feature/schema/bug/issue should have its own branch, and only one member should work on one branch/file at a time. Before making any new branch, make sure to sync the fork and run `git pull` to avoid conflicts with the common team repo._

1. **Create ERD Diagram** with entities, attributes, and relationships. Include the ERD as an image in the project.

2. **Design the API Endpoints** to follow REST API architecture. Document the endpoints in `.md` files, providing detailed explanations of queries, parameters, request bodies, authentication requirements (if applicable), sample responses, and status codes.

3. **Basic Entities** (Additional entities may be included as needed):

   - User
   - Project
   - Workspace
   - Task
   - Issue
   - Comment (optional)
   - Notification (optional)

4. **Develop Backend Server** using CLEAN Architecture:

   - Each collection should contain at least 5 records by the delivery date, except for tasks and issues, which should have at least 20 records each.
   - Implement user authentication and authorization appropriately.
   - Use exception handler to provide meaningful responses to users.
   - Unit testing is required primarily for the Domain and Service layers. It would be ideal to test also the controllers and data access.
   - Deployment: Database [neon.tech](https://neon.tech/) , Server [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service) (will be demonstrated in the lecture)
   - The README file should clearly describe the project with sufficient detail and a readable structure.

---

## Mandatory Features

- **User Management**

  - User registration and login functionality
  - User authentication using email/password or other methods (e.g., Google, GitHub)
  - Custom roles and permissions (e.g., HR, Dev, PM, Guest)

- **Projects and Workspaces**

  - Ability to create and manage multiple projects/workspaces
  - Project details: name, description, start/end dates, status

- **Tasks and Issues**

  - Task/issue creation with title, description, priority, and deadline
  - Task/issue tracking: status updates (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Done)
  - Assign tasks/issues to team members or specific users

- **Boards and Kanban (UI-related)**
  - Customizable boards for different projects/workspaces
  - Card-based representation of tasks/issues on the board
  - Drag-and-drop reordering of cards
  - Board filters and custom views (e.g., due dates, priority)

---

## Optional Features

- **Collaboration and Communication**

  - Notification system: email/text updates on task/issue changes
  - Tagging team members in comments
  - File attachments and commenting on tasks/issues

- **Real-Time Collaboration**

  - Real-time commenting with instant updates for team members
  - Auto-updates for task statuses

- **Integrations and APIs**

  - Integration with Google Drive, Trello, Slack, GitHub issues, calendar, and email clients

- **Gantt Charts and Timelines**

  - Gantt chart visualization for project timelines

- **Reporting and Analytics**
  - Customizable dashboards for project leaders and stakeholders
  - Task/issue analytics: time spent, effort required, conversion rates, etc.

---

## Optional Database Advanced Operations

For the following features, you might take advantage of **transactions**, **complex functions**, and **stored procedures**:

1. **Project and Task Management with Dependencies**

   - Prevent a project from being marked as complete until all tasks and issues are resolved using a transaction.

2. **Bulk Task Assignment or Status Updates**

   - Bulk assign tasks or update statuses within a transaction to ensure either all updates succeed or none do.

3. **Complex Query for Reporting and Analytics**

   - Implement advanced queries for metrics like average completion time, burn-down charts, and task completion rates using user-defined functions or views.

4. **Activity Log Generation**

   - A stored procedure logs user activity whenever a task or comment is modified, capturing timestamps, user IDs, and action descriptions.

5. **Notification System**
   - Use a trigger or stored procedure to automatically generate notifications on task or issue updates.
6. **Data Clean-Up and Maintenance Scripts**
   - Use stored procedures for regular cleanup of old data, such as notifications or completed tasks in archived projects.

## Getting Started

Here is the recommended order:

- Plan the Database Schema before starting any code.
- Set Up the Project Structure.
- Build the Models.
- Create the Repositories.
- Build the Services.
- Set Up Authentication & Authorization.
- Build the Controllers.
- Implement Error Handling Middleware.

## Set up the database

There are few things you need to do before getting the database up and running:

### 1. Create the database

Use pgAdmin and create a database (rfDatabase is the name being used atm)

### 2. Change connection strings

In app.settings.json in the Framework folder update the connectionstring with your name, password, databasename, host, and port there to match the one in your database (currently it is user postgres with password 1234)

```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=5432;Database=rfDatabase;User ID=postgres;Password=1234"
   }
```

### 3. Run the migrations

Then cd into Framework, and run dotnet ef database update
Hopefully everything works from there

## Authentication Configuration

To set up authentication for the application, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Configuration File

Add an `appsettings.Development.json` file to the `RhythmFlow.Framework` project.

### 2. Populate the File

Copy and paste the following JSON content into the `appsettings.Development.json` file:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "Jwt": {
    "Secret": "OurSuperSecretKeyHere1234567890andSoOn",
    "Issuer": "Rhythmflow",
    "Audience": "Rhythmflow",
    "TokenLifetime": 60
  }
}
```

### 3. Run the app in development mode

In the `RhythmFlow.Framework` project run `export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development && dotnet run`
